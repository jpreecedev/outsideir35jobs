## Outside IR35 jobs for Front-end and Full Stack Developers

My website [Outside IR35 Jobs](https://outsideir35jobs.io) was designed and built to help developer find Outside IR35 contract opportunities, specifically for those identifying as Front-end and Full Stack.

I build this website myself because I am currently without a gig due to the impact of Coronavirus on the wider economy.

## Technology Stack

The website itself is very simple.

OutsideIR35Jobs.io was written using Angular 9.1, and scaffolded using the CLI. The website is serverless and hosting in an Amazon S3 bucket, proxyed by Cloudflare.

- Angular 9.1
- Serverless
- Amazon S3, Cloudflare
- TypeScript
- Firebase Firestore
- Detailed unit tests using Jasmine & Karma

The website took about 10 hours to build over 2 days.

## Reasoning

I built this website purely because I was looking to refresh my knowledge on Angular 2+. It has been a little while since I last worked in this arena and wanted to refresh my memory should any appropriate opportunities become available.

The website is of course MVP but could be expanded with some of the following features;

- Authentication - Require users to create an account before submitting a job post
- Email reminders (achieved using a combination of Firebase triggers and AWS SES)
- Accept payments for posts via Stripe integration

More to come!
